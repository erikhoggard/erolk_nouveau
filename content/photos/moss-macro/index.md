I took my camera out into one of the few nearby "hiking trails" in Indy. This particular trail ended up actually
being a mountain biking trail, which I didn't realize until I was about half a mile into it. The whole experience kind
of sucked, but I did end up getting this cool 1:1 macro shot of some moss.

This is probably the shot that really got me into Mosstographyâ„¢.
I still love this shot, but I regret not opening the aperture all the way for that perfectly-circular bokeh.
A learning experience!
