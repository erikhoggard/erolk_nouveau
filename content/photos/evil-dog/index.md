In Vegas, we stayed at the Vdara hotel for a few nights. We often walked through the Cosmopolitan to avoid going outside
in June, where the temps were in the high 90s most days. For some inexplicable reason, there's a hallway connecting the
Vdara and the Cosmopolitan that contains these terrifying
dog statues.

The room was really dimly lit and I didn't have a tripod, so this shot turned out really shaky. And on top
of that, it has these weird blue spots. I've seen these blue marks on a few other shots. It seems to be something that
happens during the development process, but I haven't figure it out yet. I'm assuming this particular photo is just
haunted
