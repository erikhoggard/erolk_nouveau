I took this picture of the old power plant during a Kayak trip down the Saint Clair River with my friend Jake.
We covered about 10 miles total, and I forgot my second roll of film in the car :(

I'm not sure what happened, but these were the colors of the photo directly from the film scanner.
I tried some pretty aggressive color correction to make it look more natural,
but afterwards I realized that I very much liked purple version. So here it is!
