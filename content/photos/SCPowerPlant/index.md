I took this picture of the St. Clair Power Plant during a Kayak trip down the Saint Clair River with my friend Jake.

I'm really not sure what happened, but these were the colors of the photo directly from the film scanner.
At first I tried some pretty aggressive color correction to make it look more natural,
but I realized I very much liked purple version. So here it is!
