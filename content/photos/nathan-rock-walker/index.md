My friend Nathan, fully embracing the desert lifestyle.

We had a group of 10ish people, hiking up Red Rock Canyon, woefully under-prepared. But these freaks did it. I can't
believe they actually made it to the top.

Whitney and I did not make it to the top. We turned back after the storm rolled in and we realized there was a non-zero
chance of being struck by lightning.
