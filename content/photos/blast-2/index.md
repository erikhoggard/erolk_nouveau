A long exposure at a local fairground. My dad messaged me that day said his band would be playing, so I went down
to check it out. When I was a kid, my siblings, cousins and I went to a local fair every year and would ride a ride just
like the one pictured. It was called the "Fireball", I think, and it was the scariest ride they had. As an adult, it's
equally terrifying, but for different reasons.

This was taken with a monopod I had bought around the same time. I think it does a pretty decent job of stabilizing the
camera,
even in low-light conditions like this.
