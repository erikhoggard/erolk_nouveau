This was an attempt at high-speed photography that would have greatly benefited from a decent lighting setup.
Taken at my Rochester Hills apartment, where I lived after moving back to Michigan from Indiana.

The spinning top pictured came with a Eurorack module
from [Mutable Instruments](https://pichenettes.github.io/mutable-instruments-documentation),
who famously bundled small wooden toys with all of their modules.
