Despite the intense grain and noise caused by underexposure, I really like this one.
This is from the first roll of film we successfully developed (we accidentally bleached the first roll before
developing, oops).

I took this during a weeknight walk on the Clinton River Trail, which is another trail I used to walk on all the time.
The trail was within easy walking distance of my Rochester Hills apartment. It's a short drive from our current house,
so we'll still head over once in a while when the weather is nice.
