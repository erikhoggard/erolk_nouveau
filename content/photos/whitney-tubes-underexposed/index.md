This was during weeknight walk on a nearby trail. Another trail I used to walk on all the time, as it was was within
easy walking distance of my Rochester Hills apartment. It's a short drive from our current house,
so we'll still head over once in a while when the weather is nice.

I like this one, despite the intense grain and noise caused by underexposure of the bottom half.
This is from the first roll of film we successfully developed (we accidentally bleached the first roll before
developing, oops).
