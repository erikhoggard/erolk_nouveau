The downtown waterfront of Marine City, MI, featuring the trademark lighthouse. This is another photo I took while 
kayaking down the St. Clair River. I grew up in Marine City, and it's always fun to go back and visit as an adult.
Nobody quite knows why, but around 40% of the businesses in MC at any given time are antique shops. Some have been 
around for decades, though most close after a year or two and are then in turn replaced by new businesses that 
themselves have relatively high likelihoods of being antique shops. So goes the cycle.

Many of the other businesses in the tiny downtown area are inexplicably niche, like a combination art gallery, specialty 
kitchenware shop and TTRPG/TCG store. *Two* different performing arts theaters. An old-timey candy shop. A shop that 
*only* sells popcorn. We're talking about a town with a population of 4,006. It's a weird place, at least an hour out of 
the way of anywhere you'd actually want to be in Michigan, but it's got its own unique charm.

So, this is my lighthouse photo.

Growing up, I saw tons of photographers out on the waterfront, all hours of the day and all seasons. Gigantic lenses, usually taking pictures of the lighthouse, freighters, birds, or various bundles of sticks protruding from the water.
