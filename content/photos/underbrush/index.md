This is actually a picture of my Aerogarden, which I had set up in my 3rd story loft/bedroom back when I was living in
Indianapolis. Pictured most prominently are thyme, basil, and thai basil.

Both the Aerogarden and the camera I took this photo with were purchased in the beginning of the Covid outbreak.
I didn't get a ton of natural light in that loft, and the Aerogarden provided some nice light and greenery during
lockdown.

Unfortunately, I've lost a lot of the pictures I took in 2020.
