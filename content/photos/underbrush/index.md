This is actually a picture of my Aerogarden, which I had growing up in my 3rd story loft room back when I was living in
Indianapolis. Pictured most prominently are thyme, basil, and thai basil.

Both the Aerogarden and the camera I took this photo with were purchased in the beginning of the Covid outbreak.
I didn't get a ton of sunlight in that loft bedroom, so the Aerogarden provided some nice light and greenery during
lockdown.
