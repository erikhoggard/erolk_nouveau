We took a day trip out from Dublin to see the Wicklow Mountains. The drive was somehow much less stressful than the
drive out west to see the cliffs. At one point we decided to do a short hike up a few of the smaller hills.

The landscape was unlike anything I've seen in the states. The clumps of grasses you can see in the photo are a
signature part of the [blanket bog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanket_bog). It can stretch for miles, and few trees
grow in the peatland. It made hiking a bit difficult, as the ground under the clumps was very wet in places.
