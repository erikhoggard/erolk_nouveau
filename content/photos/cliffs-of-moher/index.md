Our short drive from Lahinch involved a single-lane, two-way road through some pretty steep hills. The road was
occasionally little more than a dirt path. On our drive out, we saw two different cars pulled over with flat tires on
what must have been a quarter-mile stretch of road. Still, it was worth it. Walking along the cliffside was a major
highlight of the trip.

Of the pictures I took at the cliffs, this is my favorite.
The tiny people at the top of the ridge put the massive scale of the cliffs into perspective.
