A fallen tree off of the Monon trail in Indianapolis. When Covid broke out, I started regularly walking the Monon
between 53rd and 86th street (I'd been working from a now-closed co-working space near 53rd and College Ave). I took my
camera out with me one day and took this picture. Probably the first time I went out with a camera and no real plans
other than to look for potentially interesting-looking objects.

I think I can trace back the spark of my interest in serious hiking and backpacking to the Monon.
In Indy, I had been living away from my family and a large majority of my friends.
These walks really helped me develop a familiarity and more personal connection to the city.
