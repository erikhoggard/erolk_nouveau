Near Lahinch â€” the Liscannor Bay, where the Irish countryside crashes and bashes into the Atlantic ocean.

I *loved* seeing the stone walls all over rural Ireland. They seemed impossibly long and sprawling. Literally everywhere
you
look.
We stayed at a small B&B in Lahinch run by a man named Sean. He taught us the many secrets of the Cliffs of Moher.
I wanted to stop and pull over for a picture on our short (but terrifying) drive from Lahinch to see the cliffs.
