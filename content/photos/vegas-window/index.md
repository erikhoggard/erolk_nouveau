I am very happy with this one; an attempt to capture the feeling of the intensity of the bright lights in Las Vegas. 
This was taken from the ~50th floor of the Vdara hotel, facing south. We had just gotten back from the Penn and Teller 
show (which was **very good**). You can see the Luxor's Sky Beam in the background, supposedly the strongest 
man-made light in the world. 

I had to take a bulb exposure to achieve the desired effect, but we hadn't brought a tripod or shutter release cable. I
ended up standing on the hotel bed, using the ironing board as a makeshift "tripod". This was the best of ~5 attempts.
I'm actually amazed this came out at all, especially considering I'd had several drinks at this point, and the camera's 
shutter was sticking, rendering about half of the shots on this roll useless.
