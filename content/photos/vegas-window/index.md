An attempt to capture the feeling of the intensity of the bright lights in Las Vegas. This was taken from the ~50th
floor of the Vdara hotel, facing south. This was right after we got back from seeing Penn and Teller.

I had to take a bulb exposure to achieve the desired effect, but we hadn't brought a tripod or shutter release cable. I
ended up standing on the hotel bed, using the ironing board as a makeshift "tripod". I'm actually amazed this came out
at all.
