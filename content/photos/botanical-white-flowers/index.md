Some tiny white flowers from
the [National Botanical Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Botanic_Gardens_(Ireland))
of Ireland. Unfortunately, I was taking a lot of pictures at the gardens, and I didn't record the names of any of the
plants I photographed.

I love how uniform the foreground of this picture is. The blur of the background and the blooming around the flowers are
both
signature effects of the Helios 44-2, which is a cheap vintage Soviet lens I was using quite a bit in Ireland.
