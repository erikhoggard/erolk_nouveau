**Kodak Gold 200, 35mm**

I took this during a morning trip to Detroit's [Eastern Market](https://easternmarket.org/) in June.
The sky was bright but with an overcast, so exposing for the midtones of this backlit building resulted in a really
grungy looking shot with tons of contrast.

Not exactly what I was expecting, but I really like how this one turned out.
