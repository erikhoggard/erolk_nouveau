I took this during a morning trip to Detroit's [Eastern Market](https://easternmarket.org/) in June.
The sky was bright but with an overcast. I really like how many subtle colors showed up in the sky,
and the sky's contrast with the foreground element.

I suspect a minor light leak is responsible for a lot of the weird colors I've seen with this camera.
I'm hesitant to fix it though, because it can create some really great effects, such as this sky gradient.
