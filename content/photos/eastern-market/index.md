I took this during a morning trip to Detroit's [Eastern Market](https://easternmarket.org/) back in June. I always love going to the Eastern 
Market. On this particular trip, we got some morel mushrooms and a fiddle-leaf fig plant, the latter of which has been
very slowly deteriorating over the last few months (it's October now) and we aren't exactly sure why. 

This shot turned out really grungy and gloomy. In reality it was a pretty nice day. Overcast, but bright.
I really like how many subtle colors showed up in the sky, and the sky's contrast with the foreground element.
I suspect a minor light leak is responsible for a lot of the weird colors I've seen with this camera.
I'm hesitant to fix it though, because it can create some interesting effects.
