We took a morning trip down to the [Eastern Market](https://easternmarket.org/) back in June. I always love going there.
On this particular day, we got some morel mushrooms and a fiddle-leaf fig plant, the latter of which has been
very slowly deteriorating over the last few months (it's October now) and we aren't exactly sure why.

This shot turned out really grungy, but in reality it was a pretty nice day. Overcast, but bright.
I love the gradient in the sky, and the stark contrast in the foreground.
I suspect a minor light leak is responsible for a lot of the weird colors I've seen with this camera.
I'm hesitant to pursue fixing it though, because it can create some interesting effects. I guess we'll see how the next
few rolls turn out.
