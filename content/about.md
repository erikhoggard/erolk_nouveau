### Who Are You? What is this???

Hello! My name is Erik.
**Nothing;Today** is a sort of a repository for all of my side projects and endeavors.

Having been unsatisfied with platforms like SoundCloud
(and also having the desire to avoid the hellscape wasteland that is modern social media),
I decided to just make my own thing, inspired by the days of web 1.0 personal websites.

I think of this as being less of a place to share content with the world, and more of a
centralized location for me to organize and document photos, audio, thoughts, etc., like a virtual bookshelf of sorts.

If you'd like to get in touch for whatever reason,
feel free to send me an email at erikhoggard@gmail.com

#### Technical Details

The site itself is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and served through AWS Cloudfront.
I've found Hugo to be a great tool for static site generation. It allows me to write everything in Markdown, and focus
purely on content generation, rather than messing around with heavy, bloated front-end frameworks.
