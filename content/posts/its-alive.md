# This is a Website

In fact, it's *my* website. I've had this idea for a few years now: A single place to keep photos, music, art, stupid
thoughts, whatever other scraps and odds and ends I have laying around. I've actually started developing some version of
a personal website multiple times. Some combination of perfectionism and massive feature creep have always prevented me
from actually bringing anything to fruition.

This time, I decided to go much simpler. Instead of some huge React or Angular project, this is a stupid, dead-simple
static website developed with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The result is an actual site, deployed to the real internet,
and it only took me a few days. I even had some time to add some basic content in the form of old photos.

## Content

Posting to Instagram, SoundCloud, etc. makes me feel gross; Disgusting. My hopes are that this site will be a more
hygenic and organic place to host my content. As an added bonus, this almost guarantees that nobody will ever see
anything that I upload.

So my current plans are to host two main types of content: photos and music. I've already uploaded some of my favorite
photos dating back to early 2020 (or at least what's left of them â€” many have unfortunately gone missing) with some
accompanying context.

I like to record my solo jam sessions on modular synth and guitar. I keep a physical notebook with patch notes, so I can
listen to each recording and have some idea of how I actually created the sounds. The idea here is to have one place for
the notes and audio files to live together. Both for my own reference, and on the off chance that anyone else wants to
listen to my weird ambient drones. I have no immediate plans to formally release any music, but that may change.

Oh, and I guess I'll make posts like this. Not quite sure what those will be about yet.
